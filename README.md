## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does it cost anything? ###

Boozang is currently totally free and will remain this way for the foreseeable future. There exists a premium tier that will unlock more functionality for teams but this is usually not necessary for the normal Wordpress user. The plan is to keep the free tier full-featured and useful, and not to limit the user experience for individual users in any way.

### Can I collaborate with other people? ###

Boozang is built for collaboration. Simply access your project in management view at https://api.boozang.com, pick the project, click Users > Add User. After typing in the email of the user, an email will be sent to the user where they will be invited to sign-up. After signing-up they will be able to access the project. Note: A maximum of two team members can collaborate in the Free tier.

### How can I do cross-browser testing? ###

It’s actually quite easy. Because Boozang is browser-agnostic, you can work creating tests in the browser of your choice. When doing cross-browser testing simple copy the URL into the browser you want to test, login and you can access and replay all the tests previously created.

### Which browsers are supported? ###

It’s been tested working on all recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE. The only known browsers which is not working is Opera and IE 8.
